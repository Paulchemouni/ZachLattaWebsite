# www.zachlatta.com redesign
A little redesign of the [zachlatta.com](zachlatta.com) website.
Doing my best with my newbie skills ðŸ«  </br>
This is for me the occasion to discover more about web programming and Git.</br>

**What this redesign brings to the website :**</br>
- A LinkedIn button in the header, that changes color when hovered, and redirecting to his webpage when clicked</br>
- Custom cursor, created in Gimp (will be redesigned to be smaller and to have some transparent areas for better ergonomics)
- New fonts</br>
- A header with a picture of Zach Latta</br>
- The email is now a *mailto* link</br>
- The hypertext links change color when hovered, following the red color palette of the webpage.</br>
