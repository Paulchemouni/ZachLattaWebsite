# www.zachlatta.com redesign
A little redesign of the [zachlatta.com](zachlatta.com) website.
Doing my best with my newbie skills ðŸ«  </br>
This is for me the occasion to discover more about web programming and Git.</br>
I implemented a LinkedIn button with color changing when hovering, and redirecting to his webpage when clicked.
Fonts were changed, a header was added, and the email is now a *mailto* link.
The hypertext links change color when hovered, following the red color palette of the webpage.
